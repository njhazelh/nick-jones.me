{"name":"Nick-jones.me","tagline":"My Personal Website","body":"# [NICK-JONES.ME](nick-jonex.me)\r\n=============\r\n\r\n*nick-jones.me* is the most recent web design project that I have decided to build(12/30/2013).  Having done a lot of complicated, yet poor quality code in php, I've decided that I want to learn Ruby on Rails.  Additionally, I think it's a good time that I learned some frameworks, so this project will incorporate both HAML and SASS scripting.  Furthermore, I've wanted to design a reponsive layout for a while, so that will be another part of this project.\r\n\r\n**nick-jones.me** will be a personal web site offering a little information about me for employers and such.  I intend to keep it as light as possible, and not get too involved in the server side scripting.\r\n\r\n## TL;DR\r\n--------\r\n- Resume Site\r\n- Down with PHP, long live Ruby\r\n- HAML\r\n- SASS\r\n- Responsive Design","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
