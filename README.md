#nick-jones.me [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/njhazelh/nick-jones.me.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/njhazelh/nick-jones.me)
nick-jones.me is my personal website.  It's been rather simple for a while, but
the plan is to much more power to it.

##Architecture
###Frontend
- Backbone
- SCSS
- HTML
- Gulp
- JavaScript (ES6?)

###Backend
Something, when I get around to it.  Maybe Flask. Maybe Haskell.

##Build
To build just run `gulp` in the project directory.  This will require that
you have nodejs v0.12, and gulp installed. SCSS also needs to be installed via the
ruby gem.  See `.travis.yml` for hints.

###Continuous Integration
This project uses Travis.
