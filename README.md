nick-jones.me
=============

*nick-jones.me* is the most recent web design project that I have decided to build(12/30/2013).  Having done a lot of complicated, yet poor quality code in php, I've decided that I want to learn Ruby on Rails.  Additionally, I think it's a good time that I learned some frameworks, so this project will incorporate both HAML and SASS scripting.  Furthermore, I've wanted to design a reponsive layout for a while, so that will be another part of this project.

*nick-jones.me* will be a personal web site offering a little information about me for employers and such.  I intend to keep it as light as possible, and not get too involved in the server side scripting.

TL;DR
-----
- Resume Site
- Down with PHP, long live Ruby
- HAML
- SASS
- Responsive Design
